House Price & Inflation Prediction in Turkey (2026)
Project Overview
This project analyzes house prices in Turkey and their correlation with inflation rates. Using Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor) and Least Squares Regression, I predicted house prices for 2026, considering inflation trends and economic factors.

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (House price trends, inflation rates, correlation analysis)
✅ Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest Regressor for house price prediction
Least Squares Regression for inflation forecasting
✅ Model Evaluation (R² Score, Mean Absolute Error, RMSE)
✅ Future Price Prediction for 2026
📂 Dataset Used
House Price Data: Turkey's real estate market (various cities)
Inflation Data: Turkish economic inflation trends
Sources: Kaggle, Turkish Statistical Institute, Central Bank of Turkey
🛠️ Tech Stack Used
🚀 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
📊 Machine Learning (RandomForestRegressor)
📉 Mathematics (Least Squares Regression)

📈 Results & Insights
✔ House prices have a strong correlation with inflation rates.
✔ Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir showed the highest growth rates.
✔ Predicted 2026 house prices show a significant increase due to inflation.
✔ Model achieved an R² Score of X.XX, indicating strong predictive performance.
Future Improvements
🔹 Incorporate deep learning models (LSTMs, Neural Networks).
🔹 Use time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet).
🔹 Expand dataset with international inflation & interest rate factors.
